## What is Fantasy Names Generator

It is an application that randomly generates names that can be used for fantasy characters, places etc. Unlike some other names generators, this generator allows to generate big numbers of names at once with just one click.

### How it works

It takes real names, analyse their patterns, and mixes them up to create new fictional fantasy names. The real names are grouped by style, origin etc. This groups are called namesets. The best results can be achieved by selecting one or two namesets. It is also possible to use custom namesets by pasting or typing text into special forms.

## Changelog (major changes)

- Version 1.2.0: Fix lack of reseting sorting names after generating new names. Fix missing space in the footer. Smaller font in the footer. Link to the source code in the footer.
- Version 1.1.0: Move "How many names do you want to generate?" radio buttons and "Generate names" button to the left section.
